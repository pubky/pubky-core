# `quota` defines the limit itself in the format $rate$rate_unit/$time_unit.
#  - $rate is a positive integer, max 4'294'967'296.
#  - $rate_unit is either "r" for requests, "kb" for kilobytes, 
#    "mb" for megabytes, "gb" for gigabytes.
#  Speed limits limit download and upload.
#  - $time_unit is either "s" for second, "m" for minute.
# `key` defines what who is rate limited. 
#  - "ip" limits based on the IP address.
#  - "user" limits based on the user pubkey. Requires the endpoint to have authentication.
# `burst` is a temporary allowance of quota that is added to the limit. 
#   By default, burst is equal the quota rate.
