    /// platform-specific rules (native or WASM), including:
    /// - Detecting `_pubky.<public-key>` hosts and applying the correct TLS handling.
    /// - Routing standard ICANN domains through the `icann_http` client on native builds.

    /// On native targets, this is effectively a thin wrapper around [`PubkyHttpClient::request`],
    /// while on WASM it also performs host transformation and may add the `pubky-host` header.

    /// parsing error if the supplied `url` is invalid.
